# Admin Change Log

Admin Change Log is a lightweight, admin-only WordPress plugin that records important administrative changes and displays them in a simple, readable timeline inside the WordPress dashboard.

The plugin is designed for agencies, site owners, and support teams who need clarity around *what changed* and *when*, without introducing noise or performance overhead.

## What it does

Admin Change Log records high-impact administrative actions such as:

- Plugin activation and deactivation  
- Theme switches  
- WordPress core updates  
- Plugin and theme updates  
- User role changes  
- Customizer “Additional CSS” updates  

All events are shown in a read-only timeline under **Tools → Admin Change Log**.

---

## What it intentionally does NOT do

This plugin is deliberately scoped and does **not**:

- Track post or page edits  
- Log page builder activity (Elementor, etc.)  
- Record login activity or IP addresses  
- Store configuration values or content  
- Track front-end behavior  

The goal is operational clarity, not surveillance.

## Why this plugin exists
